# A Simple High Throughput Result Declaration System

This is an ongoing project. Feel free to pitch in with other framework implementations!

I was reminded a couple days ago just how ridiculously horrible the systems that multiple organisations like CBSE and JEE use to show their results are when my cousins had to wait for hours on end to see their results, constantly redirected to unhelpful 500 pages.

I wonder if I can make a system which can do a much better job at this.
To do this, I'll follow the following phases.

1. I'll figure out the goals and requirements of the project.
2. I'll implement the backend in flask, so as to set a baseline as well as a "ground truth implementation."
3. I'll implement the backend in a couple frameworks (which I'm lazily choosing by writing simple json response api's in a bunch of them and choosing from there, more below.)
4. ???
5. Profit (?)
